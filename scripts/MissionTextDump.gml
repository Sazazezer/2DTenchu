                    save for one young boy about my age. The compound was the last bastion for #
                    the family and had no infestations. The boy said he would change the future #
                    of his clan. It looks like he was wrong.##

                    How this book made it back to this side of the pond is anyone’s guess. See #
                    it as a manual for demonic practises. From what i remember the last time i #
                    saw it the instructions were painfully simple. It’s more a how to guide than 
                    an arcane tome. ##

                    family. Just destroy it any means necessary. I don’t want your successors #
                    to deal with this again in fifty years time.##
