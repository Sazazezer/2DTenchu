/*
One of the main differences between the Textbox Engine V3 and V4
is the changing of the text storage method.

I've decided to make a script that stores the entirity of the
game's text as opposed to stuffing it in creation codes or altering
the textbox's local variables on creation.

This should alleviate the problem of finding certain text strings
in games with a lot of text, and should make it easier to refer to
when using the textbox prompts.
